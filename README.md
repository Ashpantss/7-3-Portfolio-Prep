How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure my code, program and software is functional and secure I made sure to test each section of my code. I would use a test case for each class nethods as I went and run it muliple times. I would keep it organized and secure by naming each variable and keeping them private. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret user needs by intergrating their requirments into my program. I would compose the JUnit tests to make sure my requirements were effective. I made sure to reference back to the users reccoomendations and incorporate it as I went. 

How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software with an open and unbiased mindset. I learn as much as I can about what is needed of me, and make sure I am reaching thesse requirements. I am willing to learn any updateable software techinques and implement them as I program. I allow myself to grow and function as I progress in my field.
